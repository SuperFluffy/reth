## Repository and Project Structure

### Tools

The repository uses a lot of different tools for testing, benchmarking and more. To ease local development, a `Makefile.toml` is included in the repository that defines most tasks we use.

Learn more about the tasks [here](./makefile.md), and more about `cargo-make` in their [repository](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make).
